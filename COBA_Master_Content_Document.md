### Sub-Page 7: How To Dress Professionally

**Title**: "A Quick Guide to Professional Dress for Men and Women"
**Presented by**: The Career Services Ambassadors (CSA)

**Display**: Visual examples with text descriptions

#### Section 1: Business Professional Attire

**For Women** (For any first meeting, business presentation, and job interview):
- Black skirt or pant suit, other neutral colors (dark gray, navy, brown) okay as long as top and bottom are matching
- Skirt suits recommended; skirts should be a little below the knee and never shorter than above the knee
- Pressed, collared button-down shirt
- Nude (skin-tone) or dark-colored panty-hose and closed-toe heels
- Dress shoes (pumps, flats, heels) – No platform or >2.5 inch heels
- Make-up should be minimal and conservative (daytime makeup)
- No visible tattoos; pale color nail polish; no perfume or body sprays
- Long hair should be pulled back away from face
- **Tip**: Keep hair and jewelry simple (i.e. studs for earrings); remove all other jewelry and piercings (i.e. nose rings, etc.)

**Visual**: [4 professional women in business suits - navy, black, gray]

**For Men** (For any first meeting, business presentation, and job interview):
- Full suit with matching jacket and pants with black belt
- Pressed, collared shirt with plain (solid, stripe, or simple pattern) tie
- Dark leather dress shoes and dark dress socks
- The bottom of the tie should just barely cover the entire belt buckle; a tie should never be too long or too short
- No cologne, visible tattoos or piercings
- Light briefcase or portfolio case
- **Tip**: A three-piece suit is acceptable for an interview, but a suit with mismatched pants and jacket is not recommended.

**Visual**: [Professional men in full business suits]

#### Section 2: Business Casual Attire

**For Men**:
- Pressed, collared, long-sleeved shirt with tie
- Dress slacks, socks, belt, and shoes
- Shirts should always be tucked in
- Jeans UNACCEPTABLE
- Closed-toe shoes

**For Women**:
- Dress pants, skirt (at or below knee), or dress okay
- Fitted blouses and sweaters/cardigans, scarves okay
- Closed-toe shoes (pumps/heels <2.5 inches)
- **Avoid**: Blingy/shiny/lacey fabric, sequins, khaki, skinny and capri pants, shorts, tight skirts, skirts shorter than knee length, low-cut and sleeveless blouses/dress, large jewelry, bulky purse, sandals, wedges, and heels > 2.5 inches.
- **Tip**: Business casual = business professional, with ONE of the articles substituted. (Ex: Full suit with a shell top for women or a full suit minus the jacket or the tie for men.)

**Visual**: [4 people in business casual attire]

#### Section 3: The Meaning of Color in Business

"The colors you wear in professional settings and interviews can affect your mood, energy, and how others may perceive you. You want to wear colors that portray positive perceptions and exude confidence, sincerity, and reliability. Here are colors with their perceived meanings:"

**Color Guide**:
- **RED** 🔴 → Action, powerful, passion and energetic
- **GREEN** 🟢 → Growth, ideas, vitality and sophistication
- **BLUE** 🔵 → Inspires confidence, success and trust. Navy blue is best color for work/interviews – more likely to get the job.
- **GOLD** 🟡 → Wealth, prosperity, luxury
- **BLACK** ⚫ → Black looks classic and sophisticated, but perceived as depressing, serious or intimidating – so add a little color to black suits.
- **PINK** 🩷 → Compassion, understanding and warmth. Pink or salmon worn by men is seen as a communicator color.
- **BROWN** 🟤 → Practical and reliable; sometimes perceived as dull
- **PURPLE** 🟣 → Inventive, creative, intuitive. Dark purple can be perceived as elegant and projects authority.
- **WHITE** ⚪ → Clean, pure, innocent, and simple
